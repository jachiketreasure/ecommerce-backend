# SPA Routing Fix for Render.com

## Problem
Getting 404 errors when accessing routes like `/Register`, `/Login`, etc. on the live site.

## Root Cause
Render.com (and other static hosting services) don't know how to handle client-side routing by default. When someone visits `/Register`, the server looks for a physical file at that path instead of serving the React app.

## Solution Files Created

### 1. `render.yaml` - Render.com Configuration
This file tells Render how to build and serve your app.

### 2. `public/_redirects` - Netlify-style Redirects
This ensures all routes redirect to `index.html`.

### 3. `vercel.json` - Vercel Configuration
If you ever move to Vercel, this handles routing.

### 4. Updated `vite.config.js`
Added proper SPA configuration.

## Steps to Fix

### Step 1: Redeploy Your Frontend
1. Commit all the new files to your repository
2. Push to GitHub
3. Redeploy on Render.com

### Step 2: Configure Render.com Settings
In your Render dashboard:
1. Go to your frontend service
2. Set **Build Command**: `npm run build`
3. Set **Publish Directory**: `dist`
4. Add Environment Variable:
   - Key: `VITE_API_BASE_URL`
   - Value: `https://ecommerce-backend-bwha.onrender.com`

### Step 3: Alternative Solutions

#### Option A: Use HashRouter (Quick Fix)
Change `BrowserRouter` to `HashRouter` in `src/main.jsx`:
```jsx
import { HashRouter } from 'react-router-dom';
// Replace BrowserRouter with HashRouter
<HashRouter>
```

#### Option B: Move to Different Platform
- **Netlify**: Better SPA support
- **Vercel**: Excellent React support
- **GitHub Pages**: Free with proper configuration

## Testing
After redeployment, test these URLs:
- `https://e-commerce-w645.onrender.com/Register`
- `https://e-commerce-w645.onrender.com/Login`
- `https://e-commerce-w645.onrender.com/Shop`

All should work without 404 errors.

## Current Status
